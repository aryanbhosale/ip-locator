# ip-locator
Was experimenting with the geolocation libraries of python and made this. It isn't exactly accurate in the sense that it just shows the city up to a certain range of the given IP address.

## How to use?

In the IPMap.py file,

g = geocoder.ip("me")

change 'me' to any IP address and find its location city. 

The 'me' signifies my IP(or any user's IP) at the moment he/she is using the locator. It'll return your location.
